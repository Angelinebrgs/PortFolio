Hello,
 this will be another portfolio i'll build using vite to config and some smoother styles i'm trying to improve.

 if you want to see it you can take it and to run it you need to have node js installed

if you have a galaxy fold can you tell me if the responsiv work well

<strong>for developers : </strong>

this is my first vite project

i used vite commande to initalise project with  :

that command npm create vite@latest.

then i choosed vanilla for javascript

and javascript (i have heard of type script but i don't know it enough)

don't forget to make a npm install after initialise a project or clone my repository (fork too)

the command to run the project in localhost is : npm run dev
